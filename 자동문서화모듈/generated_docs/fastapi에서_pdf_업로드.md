Okay, I need to create a README file based on the provided conversation. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The conversation involves a user having trouble extracting Korean text from a PDF using PyMuPDF in FastAPI. The text extraction was breaking due to font issues and line breaks making it messy. The assistant suggested using 'blocks' mode, adjusting the AA level, sorting blocks, and merging them into a single string.

Now, I need to create a README document following the given template. First, I'll extract project information from the conversation. The project is about PDF text extraction in FastAPI with PyMuPDF.

In the "개요" section, I should summarize what the project does: extracting text from uploaded PDFs using PyMuPDF and handling Korean text issues.

For features, based on the conversation:
1. PDF upload functionality.
2. Text extraction using PyMuPDF.
3. Handling broken fonts in text extraction.
4. Proper sorting of extracted blocks to form readable sentences.
5. Code example demonstrating the endpoint.

Installation command would likely involve installing PyMuPDF and its dependencies as per the code provided.

In the "usage_example", I'll include a sample FastAPI client code showing how to upload a PDF and get the text, incorporating the fixes from the conversation.

References should point to the PyMuPDF documentation since that's what was used.

I need to make sure all information is in Korean as per the template. Also, ensure that any undefined terms are explained clearly or removed if necessary.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each section with appropriate markdown formatting and fill in the placeholders with accurate information from the conversation.

## 설치 방법
```bash
pip install fitz fpdf2 PyMuPDF
```

## 사용 방법
```python
from fastapi import UploadFile, APIRouter, HTTPException
from pdfprocess.pdf import PyMuPDF

app = APIRouter()

@ app.post("/upload-pdf")
async def upload_pdf(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    contents = await file.read()
    with open("temp.pdf", "wb") as f:
        f.write(contents)
    
    pmf = PyMuPDF.PyMuPDF()
    pmf.load("temp.pdf")
    text_list = []
    
    for page_num in range(pmf.nums):
        page = pmf.get_page(page_num)
        blocks = page.get_text("blocks")
        
        # Sort blocks by y and x coordinates to arrange words correctly
        sorted_blocks = sorted(blocks, key=lambda b: (b[1], b[0]))
        # Extract text from each block and join them into a sentence
        sentence = ' '.join([block[4] for block in sorted_blocks])
        
        if sentence.strip():  # Only add non-empty sentences to the list
            text_list.append(sentence)
    
    return {"text": '\n'.join(text_list)}

@app.get("/status")
async def status():
    return {"status": " developed"}
```
