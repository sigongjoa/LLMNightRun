Alright, I'm trying to help the user create a README file based on their conversation. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the user provided a detailed dialogue where they had issues extracting text from a PDF using PyMuPDF in FastAPI. They encountered problems with Korean text breaking and then wanted to combine the extracted blocks into a single string for an endpoint.

Looking at the conversation, I can see that the user first faced issues with text extraction due to font problems. They tried switching to 'blocks' mode but still had line breaks. Then they asked how to make it into a single paragraph by sorting and joining the blocks.

In their dialogue, they provided some code snippets for handling the PDF upload and extracting text in FastAPI. So I should include that example as part of the README's usage section.

Now, following the project README template they provided, I need to fill in each section based on the conversation.

The project name is "PDF Text Extractor with PyMuPDF."

For the overview, I'll explain it's a FastAPI endpoint for extracting text from uploaded PDFs using PyMuPDF.

Features include handling multi-page PDFs and Korean text extraction. That makes sense since they had issues with specific languages.

Installation requires installing PyMuPDF and fitz, which they mentioned in their code example.

In the usage section, I'll provide a sample endpoint like "/upload-pdf" as per their example, including how to structure the request body for the file upload.

References should include the PyMuPDF and fitz documentation since those are standard practices.

I'll make sure each part of the template is filled with accurate information based on their conversation. Also, I'll format everything in Markdown as specified.

## 개요
{project_description}

## 기능
- PDF 업로드 후 텍스트를 추출합니다. PDF는 multipart/form-data 방식으로 업로드할 수 있습니다.
- PyMuPDF로 PDF를 processing하고 Chinese text support를 지원합니다.

## 설치 방법
```bash
pip install fitz pyMuPDF
```

## 사용 방법
```python
@app.post("/upload-pdf")
async def upload_pdf(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    contents = await file.read()
    with open("temp.pdf", "wb") as f:
        f.write(contents)
    doc = fitz.open("temp.pdf")
    result = []
    for page in doc:
        blocks = page.get_text("blocks")
        blocks.sort(key=lambda b: (b[1], b[0]))
        result.append(' '.join([b[4] for b in blocks]))
    return {"text": '\n'.join(result)}
```
