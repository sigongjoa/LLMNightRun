Okay, I need to create a README document based on the user's conversation about using FastAPI with PyMuPDF for PDF text extraction. Let me start by understanding what each part of the conversation entails.

The user first faced an issue where using PyMuPDF resulted in broken Korean text during text extraction from a PDF upload. The assistant suggested trying 'blocks' mode instead of the default, which worked but caused line breaks to be messy. Then, the user asked how to make the extracted text into a single coherent paragraph.

Looking at the code example provided by the assistant, I can see it involves reading the file, processing each page's blocks, sorting them, and joining the texts. This suggests that the README should include installation steps for PyMuPDF, the necessary dependencies like fitz, and how to set up the environment with a Python interpreter.

The project seems to be about creating a FastAPI endpoint for PDF upload, so I'll outline features such as PDF upload, text extraction, and API endpoints. The usage example provided is in Python, which should be included in the README's usage section.

I also need to structure this according to the given README template: a title, description, features, installation commands, usage examples, references, and license info. Since there are no specific references or licenses mentioned by the user, I'll assume placeholders can be used if necessary, but for now, I'll keep them as comments.

I should ensure that each section is clear and concise, using markdown formatting without any markdown code blocks, just plain text. The code example should be properly indented and included in a code block at the end.

Finally, I'll compile all these elements into the README structure, making sure it's comprehensive yet easy to follow.

# PDF Text Extraction with FastAPI

## 개요
이/project/는 FastAPI 기반의 PDF 업로드와 텍스트 추출을 지원做的开源 project입니다. PDF文档 upload를 통해 internal text Extraction을 performed하고, extracted text를 API endpoint를 통해 remote server에 send할 수 있습니다.

## 기능
- PDF document upload support
- Internal text Extraction using PyMuPDF
- FastAPI endpoint for text extraction and storage

## 설치 방법
```bash
pip install fitz requests
```

## Usage Example
```python
from fastapi import UploadFile, HTTPException
from pyMuPDF import fitz

@app.post("/upload-pdf")
async def upload_pdf(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    contents = await file.read()
    with open("temp.pdf", "wb") as f:
        f.write(contents)
    
    doc = fitz.open("temp.pdf")
    result = []
    for page_num, page in enumerate(doc):
        blocks = page.get_text('blocks')
        blocks.sort(key=lambda b: (b[1], b[0]))
        result.append(' '.join([b[4] for b in blocks]))
    
    return {"text": '\n'.join(result)}
```
