Okay, I need to create an INSTALL document based on the provided conversation. Let me first understand what's in the conversation.

The user is having trouble extracting text from a PDF using PyMuPDF because the text isn't rendering correctly and the lines aren't breaking properly. They tried changing to 'blocks' mode but still had issues with line breaks not aligning, which they want fixed so that all the extracted text forms one coherent paragraph instead of separate lines.

So, the main goal is to help them fix the PDF extraction issue in FastAPI. The previous assistant suggested using 'blocks' and sorting them by coordinates, then joining the text. I should include this method but also think about adding a code example for clarity since that's part of their request.

I'll structure the INSTALL document based on the provided template. It should have system requirements, installation steps, environment setup, and problem-solving sections.

First, the system requirements will include Python version compatibility with PyMuPDF and Fitzen. Then, outline each step: installing required libraries using pip, importing necessary modules, reading the uploaded file, processing it with Fitzen to extract text in lines, handling errors if something goes wrong, creating an endpoint function that handles POST requests for PDF uploads, and including an example endpoint.

In the problem-solving section, I'll explain common issues like font problems and incorrect text extraction. The solution will involve adjusting the text retrieval method as discussed earlier.

I need to make sure all steps are clear and concise, and include code snippets where necessary. Also, provide a complete markdown document with proper headings and bullet points for readability.

Finally, check that everything is in Korean since the conversation was in Korean.

# PDF Text Extraction with FastAPI  
**INSTALL Documentary**

## System Requirements  
- Python 3.8及以上  
- PyMuPDF 2.0及以上  
- Fitzen 1.4及以上  

## Installation Steps  
1. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Run the following command in your terminal to install the necessary libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install fitz PyMuPDF-binary-fitz
   ```

2. **Import Necessary Modules**  
   In your FastAPI application, import the required modules:  
   ```python
   from fastapi import UploadFile, APIRouter, HTTPException
   from PIL import Image
   import fitz  # Using Fitzen instead of PyMuPDF for better font handling
   ```

3. **Read Uploaded File**  
   Create a function to handle file uploads and extract text:  
   ```python
   def upload_handler(file: UploadFile) -> str:
       contents = await file.read()
       with open("temp.pdf", "wb") as f:
           f.write(contents)
       
       # Extract text in lines using Fitzen
       doc = fitz.open("temp.pdf")
       blocks_list = []
       for page_num, page in enumerate(doc):
           blocks = page.get_text("blocks")
           if not blocks:  
               continue
           blocks_list.append(blocks)
   
       # Sort blocks by coordinates and extract text
       blocks_list.sort(key=lambda b: (b[1] + b[4], b[0]))
       extracted_text = ' '.join([block[4].strip() for block in blocks_list])
       
       return {"text": extracted_text}
   ```

## Environment Setup  
Set your working directory and install dependencies as needed.  
```bash
cd /your.work.directory/
pip install fitz PyMuPDF-binary-fitz
```

## Problem Solving  
- **Issue**: PDF text extraction fails with incorrect line breaks or missing characters.  
  **Solution**: Use `fitz.get_text("blocks")` instead of `"text"`, sort the extracted blocks by their coordinates, and join them into a single string to maintain proper sentence flow.

# PDF Text Extraction with FastAPI  
**INSTALL DOCUMENT**

## System Requirements  
- Python 3.8及以上  
- PyMuPDF v2.0及以上  
- Fitzen v1.4及以上  

## Installation Steps  
1. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Run the following command in your terminal to install the necessary libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install fitz PyMuPDF-binary-fitz
   ```

2. **Import Necessary Modules**  
   In your FastAPI application, import the required modules:  
   ```python
   from fastapi import UploadFile, APIRouter, HTTPException
   from PIL import Image
   import fitz  # Using Fitzen for better text extraction handling
   ```

3. **Create Text Extraction Endpoint**  
   Implement an endpoint to handle PDF uploads and extract text using PyMuPDF:  
   ```python
   router = APIRouter()

   @router.post("/upload-pdf")
   async def upload_pdf(file: UploadFile):
       contents = await file.read()
       with open("temp.pdf", "wb") as f:
           f.write(contents)
       
       doc = fitz.open("temp.pdf")
       blocks_list = []
       for page_num, page in enumerate(doc):
           blocks = page.get_text("blocks")
           if not blocks:  
               continue
           blocks_list.append(blocks)
   
       # Sort blocks by coordinates to merge lines correctly
       blocks_list.sort(key=lambda b: (b[1] + b[4], b[0]))
       extracted_text = ' '.join([block[4].strip() for block in blocks_list])
       
       return {"text": extracted_text}
   ```

**Example Usage**  
```python
@app.post("/upload-pdf")
async def upload_pdf(file: UploadFile):
    contents = await file.read()
    with open("temp.pdf", "wb") as f:
        f.write(contents)
    
    doc = fitz.open("temp.pdf")
    blocks_list = []
    for page_num, page in enumerate(doc):
        blocks = page.get_text("blocks")
        if not blocks:  
            continue
        blocks_list.append(blocks)
    
    # Sort blocks by coordinates to merge lines correctly
    blocks_list.sort(key=lambda b: (b[1] + b[4], b[0]))
    extracted_text = ' '.join([block[4].strip() for block in blocks_list])
    
    return {"text": extracted_text}
```
