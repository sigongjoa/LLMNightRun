Here\u2019s a simple Python code example that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console:\n\n```python\n# This is a comment explaining what the code does\n# It's a simple program to print \"Hello, World!\" to the console\n\n# The main function is the entry point of the program\ndef main():\n    # Print a string to the console\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n# Check if this file is being run directly (not imported as a module)\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Call the main function when the script is executed\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Comments**: The code includes comments to explain what each part does. Comments are useful for documentation and understanding the code without running it.\n2. **Function Definition**: The `main()` function contains the core logic of the program. In this case, it simply prints \"Hello, World!\".\n3. **Conditional Execution**: The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block ensures that the `main()` function is only called when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).\n\nThis code follows basic best practices for Python programming, such as using meaningful variable names and comments to enhance readability.",
