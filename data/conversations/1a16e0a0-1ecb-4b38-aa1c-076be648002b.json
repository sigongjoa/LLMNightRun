The `Card` class represents individual cards with their suits and ranks. It also includes methods to calculate the numeric value based on common poker rules where face cards (Jack, Queen, King) count as 10 points each, while Ace counts either as 11 (high) or 1 (low), depending on the rest of the hand\u2019s value.\n   ```python\n   class Card:\n       ...\n   ```\n   \n2. **Deck Class** manages the creation, shuffling, and dealing of cards from the deck. It ensures proper handling of edge cases like checking if the deck has been shuffled before dealing and preventing empty hands.\n   ```python\n   \n   class Deck:\n       ...\n   ```\n\n3. **Gameplay Logic**: A function called `play_game()` handles the core mechanics of the poker game including creating the deck, dealing cards to each player, allowing them to take turns hitting or standing, and determining the winner at the end of the round.\n\nThis script provides a basic framework which could serve as the foundation for expanding into more complex features like betting systems, ante requirements, community cards etc., according to specific requirements and desired depth of the poker simulation.",
